Preprocessing Status: COMPLETE AND PROPERPreprocessing Status: ✓ COMPLETE AND PROPER



The data has been properly cleaned and validated.The data has been properly cleaned and validated.

The low model performance (19.8%) is NOT due to preprocessing errors.The low model performance (19.8%) is NOT due to preprocessing errors.



Root Cause:Root Cause:

  - 100% of test words are unseen (0% overlap with corpus)  • 100% of test words are unseen (0% overlap with corpus)

  - HMM model relies on word-level matching  • HMM model relies on word-level matching

  - Falls back to pure letter frequencies for all test words  • Falls back to pure letter frequencies for all test words
